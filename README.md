# Basic Signup Page

## About
This is the code for a basic signup page. I will be using images and text to design a simple landing page for a clothing brand.
This project was made during the Odin Project.

## Goals
* Duplicate TOP layout from assignment
* Add unique images and text
* Add inputs for user information
* Use GitHub commits to track and upload changes

## Thoughts
Pretty cool and I am happy with how it turned out. I could probably work on the styling a little more but right now the page looks good and is functional. I added a script to verify the password and make sure that the fields match. Also added mobile formatting to make the page work on all screens.
